Which model did the best for the colour-prediction task? Can you give a theory about why?
The K nearest neighbors model seemed to give the best prediction, with SVM being close.
I think K nearest works well for colours because colours close to each other are probably the same or very
similar and probably in the same category as each other.

Have a look at the cities in your test data where the weather model makes the wrong prediction.
Do you feel like the model is making reasonable mistakes?
Yes, a lot of the errors seem to be cities like Vancouver/Seattle or Toronto/Ottawa that have
very similar weather patterns even on a daily basis because they're close together so there
probably isn't any reasonable way to tell them apart from data.

Can you think of any weather features that we could potentially add to make better predictions?
humidity might help, some areas that are relatively close to each other might have different humidity
levels if they're more inland or in areas that have swaps etc that might make it feel.
Also wind speeds and direction could help, depending on the local geography or where the ocean/water is
the wind directions might be different for places with similar temperatures, rainfall, and snowfall, and
help to distinguish them.
