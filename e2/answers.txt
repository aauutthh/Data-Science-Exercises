In the hint above, describe the values that are the result of data['timestamp']*fit.slope + fit.intercept?
  It's the equation of a line, y = mx+b where:
    m = fit.slope,
    b = fit.intercept,
    data['timestamp'] is the x value

How is this calculated?
  the slope and intercept were calculated by the linear regression function we ran on the data. The result is calculated
  by matplotlib applying our y=mx+b equation to each data['timestamp'] value and plotting the resulting y

In the same hint, why does this produce a fit line on the graph?
  because for each x point it produces a y point on the graph in the shape of a line since we're passing it an equation for a line
  and we're using 'r-' which creates a line between each point so it ends up creating a line.

Why are the created_at values and timestamp values paired correctly to make points on the plot?
  Because there is a 1 to 1 mapping of created_at values to timestamps, the timestamps are just a
  different representation of the created_at values.
