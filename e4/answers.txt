Based on your results for the last question, do you think daily temperatures are a good way to predict population density?
Briefly explain why or why not.

 If you're looking at temperatures that have an extreme value outside of the 15-30c range it is less likely that there
 will be a high density population there, but within the 15-30c range it seems to be evenly distributed across the
 range, with maybe a slight preference to higher density areas being in more moderate temperature areas around 15-20c.

The larger data file (stations.json.gz) was kept compressed throughout the analysis. Constantly decompressing the data
seems inefficient. Why might this be faster than working with the uncompressed .json data?

 We only open the file inot memory once so I think the reading time is overall a very small percentage of the overall
 exeuction this would become more true with more advanced analysis going on, so I don't think there is much of a difference
 between reading a compressed or uncompressed file.

 Doing a timing comparison between the two it looks like they are both nearly the same speed to read
 0.045042991638183594 - compressed
 0.043041229248046875 - uncompressed
 Working with the compressed file would be nicer since it saves space, the compressed json is 73kb vs uncompressed
 one being 1216kb, with very large data sets having uncompressed data would eat a lot more disk space needlessly.
