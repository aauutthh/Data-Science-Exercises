Looking at your dog-rates.ipynb, do you think the residual are close-enough to being normal to look at the OLS p-value?
Yes the histogram output looks close enough to normal with it centered at about 0.

Can you reasonably conclude that the ratings are increasing?
Yes the p-value is very small p < 0.05, so we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no increase over time.


Do you think that the new “better” prediction is letting the Kalman filter do a better job capturing the true signal in the noise?
yes the better prediction seems to make the Kalman filter follow the data very well with capturing the extreme value spikes.
while staying relatively smooth when the temperature is staying between a small range with few outliers.
