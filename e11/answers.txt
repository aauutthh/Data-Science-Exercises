In your reddit_relative.py, what intermediate results did you .cache()?
Briefly describe what would have happened if you hadn't used .cache() anywhere.
(No need to time it, unless you really want to.)
cached the comments dataframe after reading it in, without it we would end up reading in the
file twice during both groupBy commands, this way after the first groupBy command the
dataframe is cached into memory so we dont need to read it again.

How did marking DataFrames for broadcast affect the running time of the “best author” program above?
using broadcasting on the dataframe sped up the program by a decent amount.
36s with broadcast on
42s with broadcast off
