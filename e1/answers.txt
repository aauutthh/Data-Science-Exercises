1. Where you did the same calculations with NumPy and Pandas, which did you find easier to work with? Which code do you think is easier to read?

  I think Panda's and dataframes are easier to work with, in both of these they're very simple so they are both very clear
  on what they're trying to do, but I think Panda's has a more clean output with how Dataframes are printed.


2. What were the running times of the two pivot_months_* functions? How can you explain the difference?

  pivot_months_pandas() had a time of 13.7 ms
  pivot_months_loops() had a time of 397 ms

  The loops function seems to be doing more iterations through the data set, and it is also sorting a list of months
  and stations. It also is allocating two different arrays of zeros which probably had to do some form of malloc/calloc
  in C which may be much slower than how Pandas allocates memory for it's dataset in one call.
  The Panda's api probably also has many optimizations in it to make inserting, modifying, and aggregating
  data much quicker since it's intended for extremely large data sets.
